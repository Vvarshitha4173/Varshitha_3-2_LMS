GIT  vs GIT HUB
Git ---> open-source, locally-installed version control system (VCS)
Git Hub ---> web-based cloud platform that hosts Git repositories

GIT HUB :
FIRST CLASS:
	git init -->(for new repository)
	git clone --> (for dowloading the created respository using hhtps link,ssh)
	we can see the downloaded file in the zip file
	git status --> (helped to check it is changed or not)
	if it shows modified then changes are done(color red)
	git add . -->(changed files can added by using this command,if it shows green color then the files are added which are changed)
	git commit -m
	git merge
	git push
	git pull
	git checkout branch_name
